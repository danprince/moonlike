# Moonlike

Below the surface of the moon there are caves

The further down you get the more the nature of the caves changes

1-5 regular moonrock
5-10 glowing moonrock
10-15 lava

Venture down collecting rocks and equipment

Play as an inventor who found no success on earth and decided to
fly to the moon instead.

As all good inventors he has an inventory
Control him as he explores the caves of the moon in search of
new materials that will allow him to make new ideas to send back to earth
